imagine you are walking up on the empire state building your playing game with a friend.
for one hundred times you throw a dice  if its 1 or 2 you'll go one step down, if its  3,
4 or 5 you will go one step up.. if you throw 6 you will throw dice again and will walk
the resulting number of steps up. you cannot go lower than step zero,chance of falling 
down is 1% when you make a move, falling down means you have to start from zero..
with all this in mind you bet your friend that you will reach 60 steps high , what is the 
chance thatyou will win this bet?

how to solve?
stimulate the process thousand times and see what fraction of stimulations you will reach 60 steps
